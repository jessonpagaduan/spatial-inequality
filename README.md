# spatial-inequality
Kuznets (1955) and Williamson (1965) theorized that during the course of economic  development, income inequality increases first, reaches a peak, and then, decreases,  thus following an inverted-U trajectory. While most empirical studies on this hypothesis focused at the country-level, empirical evidence at the subnational level are scarce,  especially for developing countries, due to the unavailability of local income accounts. The growing popularity of nighttime lights (NTL) from satellites as proxy for local economic  activity has allowed some studies to develop local (spatial) inequality indices. However, most analyses use the flawed Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational  Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) NTL product, which suffers from blurring, top-coding, and  lack of on-board calibration.  In this study, we combine a novel NTL dataset with net primary productivity (NPP) and  land cover data to construct a panel of province-level estimates of gross domestic product  (GDP) per capita in the Philippines from 2000 to 2018. Given these estimates, we are able to calculate region-level measures of spatial inequality, which we then use to (1)  analyze sigma convergence, (2) estimate the Kuznets curve through parametric and  semiparametric methods, and (3) test whether the shift from the agriculture to the industry  and services sectors causes spatial inequality
